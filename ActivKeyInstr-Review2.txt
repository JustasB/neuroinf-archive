This e-mail contains instructions for your help in reviewing 
submissions to CNS*02 which will be held in Chicago this summer 
(http://www.neuroinf.org/CNS.shtml).  We received a total of 246 
submissions all of which have been checked and approved by the 
program committee (we reject only papers which have either no 
biological content or which are of extremely poor writing).

A 110 authors requested an oral contribution, while we have slots for 
only ~40 'regular' 20 min talks plus ~8 'featured' 50 min talks. 
Your task is to help us in making this selection.  You are asked to 
review 4-9 submissions and score them for quality, significance, 
novelty and appropriateness of the work and for clarity of the 
submission.  You can also make a suggested assignment (poster, oral, 
featured oral).  As a new rule in 2002 we only give featured oral 
contributions to authors who specifically requested this.  Please do 
not forget to press submit when you're done.

We would like to finalize the program begin May, therefore we kindly 
ask you to finish your review by Friday April 26th.

To start the review process, please go to http://www.neuroinf.org 
and press the button "my menu" and follow the instructions on the 
logon-screen. After a successful logon (or new registration if this was 
your first visit) you will see your menu. 
Follow the link "Activate my new privileges". You will be asked to
enter the activation key provided at the bottom of this mail. After 
submission of this form the system provides a link back to your menu.

When you go back to the menu or logon later you will notice that you have
a new menu-item :
