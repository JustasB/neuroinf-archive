This paper must be scored both for publication in the conference proceedings (special issue of the Neurocomputing journal) and for oral presentation.  See the invitation letter for more info.  You give the following scores: <br>
<b>Quality</b> This is a very important score overall and describes the quality of the work described in the paper. <br>
<b>Significance</b>  Is the work of sufficient significance to be presented at the CNS meeting?<br>
<b>Originality</b>  Is the work described original?  Originality is related both to previous work of the authors and to the field overall.  Complete lack of originality should receive a Bad score and may be a reason to reject the paper for publication.<br>
